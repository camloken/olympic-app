## UI/UX Front-End Code and Design Challenge

### Story
Create an interactive visualization to tell a short story using data from [past olympics](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/version/2). The objective is to demonstrate your ability to:  

- Manipulate and transform data 
- Use kickass design principles
- Leverage modern Javascript
- Create simple, intuitive user interactions
- Do all of the above while making it _look_ awesome!

### Ideas
Here are a few ideas to pursue, but feel free to explore the data and tell your own story.

1. Chart the average age of an Olympian over the years splitting out Summer vs Winter. Then see how that changes depending on the Sport.

3. Create an interactive map (Mapbox, d3, deck.gl) showing number of Olympic medals by country. Consider breaking data down by city and medal type.

5. Create a Medal standings visualization showing the Medal count per Team. Allow a user to select the year and/or Sport to interact with the visualization.

### Requirements
- Use [past olympics data](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/version/2)
- Should be an interactive visualization
- Should use this React boilerplate
- App should be responsive
- Spend no more than 6 hours

### Resources
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- [deck.gl](http://deck.gl/#/)
- [Mapbox.gl](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
